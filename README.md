# speed-difference-neural-net
Main idea is to train a net to predict the speed change while a car is driving from the image difference of sequential frames

As it is trained on the same data-set. we can compare the rmse with https://github.com/g0dsdiedreaming/comma-ai-challenge-baseline

Would require the initial speed of the sequence to be provided, and estimation happen based on that.
